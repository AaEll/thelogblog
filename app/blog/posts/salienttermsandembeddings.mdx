## Origins of Salient Terms 

The term 'salient terms' in the information retrieval literature is first referenced in an almost-uncited conference paper from September 2002, 
*Using Salient Words to Perform Categorization of Web Sites\** [1]. This paper from the same era of information retrieval as page-rank [2], 
has only received 1 citation as of the writing of this blog post. Later the same year, *Detecting Similar Documents Using Salient Terms* is published
by Cooper et.al. from the IBM Watson [3].

Despite these humble origins, salient terms has become a widely known
set of algorithms within industry [4].


Since then, *salient terms* has come to represent a variety of term weighting algorithm with the goal of highly weighting terms related to the subject of the document [4].

For example, this article is a document that references 'salient-terms' as a term, and 'page-rank' as a term. 
However, if a user was searching for 'page-rank' this document would not be relevant, and page rank is only tertially involved in the article. 
The key subject of this article and most salient term is 'salient-terms'.


### Popularity Salient Terms 

Popularity has long been an embarrassingly effective signal, as shown in Ca√±amares, Castells (2018), winner of SIGIR 2018 best paper award [5].

The Salient Terms algorithm I'd like to bring forward is Popularity Salient Terms.
Popularity Salient Terms maintains a count of popularity at a per-item-term level.

<u>Popularity Salient Terms</u>
```
key_db // our distributed keystore database of (term, item_id) : val
key_db.increment(term,item_id) --> increment val by 1
query // user search query
query_terms // user search query split into a list of terms
item_id // unique item ID of item interacted with

// when user interacts with a search item for a given query
...
for term in query_terms:
  key_db.increment(term, item_id)
```

We could make modifications if we want to maintain a moving window for popularity

<u>Moving Window Popularity Salient Terms</u>
```
event_db // our event logging database  
event_db.salient_terms_events // an event table with columns(query_terms, item_id, timestamp)
event_db.salient_terms_events 
  .insert(query_terms,item_id, timestamp) --> insert a record into salient_terms
event_db.salient_terms_extract // a table we store daily extract with columns (extract_date, term, item_id)
key_db // our distributed keystore database of (term, item_id) : val
key_db.set(term,item_id,new_val) --> set (term,item_id) to new_val
key_db.reset() --> drop records or reset val to 0
query // user search query
query_terms // user search query split into a list of terms
item_id // unique item ID of item interacted with
N // number of days in our moving window
<TODAY-N> , <TODAY> // SQL Macros for the relevant dates

// when user interacts with a search item for a given query
...
db.insert(query_terms, item_id)

// in a daily sql-pipeline
INSERT INTO salient_terms_extract
(
SELECT <TODAY>, exploded_terms.value as term, item_id, COUNT(*)
FROM salient_terms_events LATERAL,
    EXPLODE(query_terms) as exploded_terms
WHERE salient_terms_events.timestamp
    BETWEEN <TODAY-N> AND <TODAY> 
GROUP BY 2,3
)

//extract salient_terms_extract into key_db using some glue code
event_db.read("SELECT * FROM salient_terms_extract WHERE extract_date=<TODAY>")
.map( record -> key_db.insert(record.term, record.item_id, record.val))
```
### How Salient Terms Fits into the Ranking/Recommendations Stack

In the age of deep learning, why do we still use such simple algorithms? If you're asking this question,
you're probably not familiar with web-scale information retrieval in practice. 

Across state-of-the-art search and recommendations systems the
*query-understanding -> query-expansion -> retrieval -> point-wise ranking -> conditional reranking* architecture is well established [4][7].
This architecture is also relevant for LLM applications, where RAG pipelines are often re-inventing the wheel
of the established state-of-the-art architecture for search and recommendations.

Within the *retrieval* layer, we need to *'retrieve'* a high-recall set of up to several thousand items from a pool of 
hundreds of millions to trillions of items. While there are some applications of deep learning in retrieval, large neural networks
are not scalable to evaluating hundreds of millions of items within the 250ms users expect from search and recommendations applications [8][9].

Typically, retrieval is achieved by combining a variety of heuristics, collaborative filtering, and deep learning algorithms that can scale 
to webscale problems [4][7]. Salient terms fits neatly into the retrieval layer as another performant heuristic algorithm for modelling query\<\-\>item relevance.

Salient terms can be used to retrieve the highest weight documents using a inverse index. 
Alternatively, the term weights can be used in heuristic algorithms e.g. page-rank or term weights can be used in features in downstream ranking models.  

### Evaluation

I'll fill this in later, if I have a free weekend \<.\< \>.\>


### Conclusions

It's an unfortunate reality the field of information retrieval has diverged between academia and industry. 
With the greatest information retrieval research and innovation hidden behind the gilded walls of Silicon Valley giants.

We can envision a future where industry can open the gates to academia and share decades of experimentation and research. 

However, that future is unlikely to happen. 
Search hasn't been this competitive since the 2000s, with startups, you.com, perplexity.ai and more
creating LLM first search engines, and chatGPT threatening to change user knowledge searching behavior away from search as a whole [10][11][12].
Google's global search market share has dropped to below 90% for the first time since 2015 [13].

Algorithms have never been the strongest competitive moat.
Especially with the Silcon Valley exodus of 2023, shuffling employees between tech giants
or ejecting them into new markets across the world [4].

However, Im not under any NDA. So I can share this information freely :D
